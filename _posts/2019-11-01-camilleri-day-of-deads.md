[Andrea Camilleri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Camilleri)'s \"Il Giorno dei Morti\" translated to English.

Up until 1943, in the night between the first and the second of November in every Sicilian house where there was a small child, dead relatives would come back to visit.

Not ghosts with a white linen in the head and chains, mind you, not those that are frightening, but those as they were seen in the photographs displayed in the living room, worn out, with the occasional half-smile on the face, wearing a perfectly-hironed dress, they would look no different than alive humans.

We <abbr title="small children">"nicareddri"</abbr>, before going to bed, would put a wicker basket under the bed (the size varied according to the money that was in the family) that the dead loved ones would fill with sweets for us to find the next morning upon awakening.

Excited, we sweated, we struggled to get some sleep: we wanted to see them, our dead relatives, while they quietly came to the bed, caressed us, lowered themselves to take the basket.

After a restless sleep we would wake up at dawn to start the search: the dead wanted to play with us, to make it fun for us, and therefore they wouldn't put the basket back where they had found it. Instead they went to hide it carefully, we had to search for it all around the house.

Never again I will experience the excitement of the finder when I discovered the basket over a cupboard or door. The toys were small tin trains, wooden cars, rag dolls, wooden puzzles of landscapes. I was 8 years old when my grandfather Giuseppe, long supplicated in my prayers, brought me the mythical [Meccano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano) from the afterlife and for the happiness burst got me some lines of fever.

The treats were those traditional, called *of the deads*: marzipan modeled and painted to look like fruit, "branches of apple trees" made of flour and honey, "mustazzola" of cooked wine and other delights such as *queen's biscotti*, tetù, carcagnette. Never missed the "puppet made of sugar" that usually depicted a [*bersagliere*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bersaglieri) playing trumpet or escorted by a very colorful dancer in a dance step.

At a certain point in the morning, combed and dressed in order, we went with the family to the cemetery to greet and thank the deads.

For us little ones it was a party, we swarmed along the small cemetery lanes to meet with friends, schoolmates: "What did the deads bring you this year?" – question that we did not ask to Tatuzzo Prestìa, who was our precise age that November 2nd when we saw him standing and composed in front of his father's grave who died the year before while holding the handlebars of a sparkling tricycle.

In other words, on November 2nd we returned the visit that the dead relatives had given us the day before: it was not a ritual, but an affectionate custom.

Then, in 1943, along with the American soldiers we got the Christmas tree, and slowly year after year the *deads* lost their way to our houses where for generations they had been awaited by happy and awaken children.

What a Pity. We had lost the opportunity to touch, physically if you will, that thread that links our personal history to that of those who had preceded us and <abbr title="gave us birth">"stampato"</abbr>, as explained to us by scientists in recent years. Today that thread and connection can be guessed only through a sci-fi microscope, and so we become poorer:

Montaigne wrote that meditation on death is meditation on freedom, because whoever has learned to die has unlearned how to serve.

– *Andrea Camilleri*
